Flask Learn
===========

:author: Joel Burton <joel@joelburton.com>

Example application from `Mastering Flask`. This book was terribly edited,
and so many bugs in their sample code had to be fixed.

This represents the complete project built in the book, except for the last
chapter, on deployment.

Useful for students to see examples of lots of Flask add-ons.
